# command-line-snake-game
Command line snake game, plays frame by frame, heavily makes use of OOP.

Next steps would be to make uses of curses so that the game doesnt need to be played frame by frame. Unfortunately could not get curses working on my windows machine.

Main file snakegame.py can be found in venv folder.
